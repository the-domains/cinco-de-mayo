Leftover chicken is used to create a rich and creamy meal-in-one. This colorful dish has zippy flavor. It's a nice change of pace from beef enchiladas.

Directions:

1. Spread about 2 tablespoons of beans on each tortilla. Combine soup and sour cream; stir in chicken. Spoon 1/3 to 1/2 cup down the center of each tortilla; top with 1 tablespoon cheese.
2. Roll up and place seam side down in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top; sprinkle with the onions, olives and remaining cheese.
3. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 35 minutes or until heated through. Just before serving, sprinkle lettuce around enchiladas if desired.
